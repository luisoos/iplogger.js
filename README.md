# iplogger.js
Simple JavaScript IP-Logger that tells you really much.

This IP-Logger tells you really much. You can use it like this:

```
window.onload = function () {
  IPLOGGER.js SOURCECODE
}
```

to send the client-side IP directly in the console. Pretty easy. You can use it with a database for example, but this is the simple way to get just the data.
